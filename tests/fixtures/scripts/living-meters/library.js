 * LIVING METERS v1.2.2: a resource framework for AI Dungeon
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Oratorian. MIT licensed; see the LICENSE file.
 * You may bundle this into your own script. Keeping this notice is all that
 * is asked.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Tracks any set of numeric resources (health, hunger, ammo, fuel, sanity,
 * gold, reputation...), drifts them each turn, reacts to what the story says,
 * and tells the AI how the character should feel and behave.
 *
 * The meters are "living" because they move on their own: each one drifts every
 * turn, reacts to what the story says, and is handed to the AI as behaviour to
 * play rather than a number to recite.
 *
 * THREE LAYERS OF CONFIGURATION
 *   1. RM_CONFIG below                 the scenario creator edits this.
 *   2. RM_PRESETS                      ready-made resource sets to start from.
 *   3. The "Living Meters" story card  the PLAYER edits this in-game; it
 *                                      overrides the creator's numbers.
 *
 * The RM_ prefix is the original working name and is kept deliberately: it is
 * short, it collides with nothing, and renaming it would break nobody's saves
 * for no gain.
 *
 * INSTALL: paste this whole file into the Library tab, then paste the three
 * companion files into Input / Context / Output. See README.md.

const RM_CONFIG = {
  // Start from a preset, then add or override resources below.
  // "survival" | "fantasy" | "scifi" | "noir" | "mechanic" | "none" |

  // If preset is "none", no resources are added by default and the preset section is ignored.
  // You must then define all resources and triggers you want in the "resources" array below.
  // Starting from line 77 and ending on line 261
  preset: "none",

  // Resources defined here are MERGED over the preset, matched by `id`.
  // Give an id that isn't in the preset to add a brand-new resource.
  //
  // TRIGGERS take plain word lists — you never write a regular expression.
  //   "coin"    matches the whole word "coin" only
  //   "loot*"   matches "loot", "looted", "looting", "looter"
  //   "dead body"  phrases are fine
  // Matching is always case-insensitive and always respects word boundaries,
  // so "rest" will not fire on "restaurant". Add the * yourself when you want
  // word endings to count.
  //
  // ==========================================================================
  // DEEP SPACE — a long-haul salvage run gone wrong.
  //
  // Twelve interlocking systems. The design intent is that no single resource
  // kills you; the ship does, because fixing one thing costs another. A burn
  // spends fuel AND adds heat. Running the reactor restores power but bakes
  // the ship and doses the crew. Repairs eat spare parts you cannot replace
  // out here. Note how several triggers share the same words across different
  // resources — that is how one narrative event moves three numbers at once.
